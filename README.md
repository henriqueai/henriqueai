# Hello 👋, I'm Henrique Santos Silva

### **Prompt Engineer | AI Systems Designer**

**17 years old. Focused on AI architecture, not just code.**

---

## 🚀 What I Do

I am a **Prompt Engineer** focused on turning complex AI ideas into **reliable, production-ready systems**. My expertise lies in applying Software Engineering principles to prompt design, ensuring:

- **Reliability:** Using strategies like Structured Chain-of-Thought (S-CoT) to minimize hallucinations.
- **Maintainability:** Treating prompts as versioned software assets (Prompt as Code).
- **Integration:** Designing JSON Schema output for seamless backend integration (TypeScript/Python).

## 🎓 My Credentials (Technical Credibility)

Despite my age, I invest in world-class education to ensure my projects are built on a solid foundation.

| Institution | Course/Area | Strategic Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Harvard University** | CS50: Introduction to Computer Science | Fundamentals of Algorithms and Data Structures |
| **Stanford University** | Cybersecurity 
| **Google** | IT and Cybersecurity Certifications | Security, Infrastructure, and Operations |
| **University of Helsinki** | Elements of AI | Ethics, Implications, and AI Fundamentals |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

My approach is language-agnostic, focused on solving the problem.

- **Languages:** TypeScript, Python, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), AI APIs (OpenAI, Gemini)
- **Methodology:** Prompt Engineering, System Design, Software Architecture

## 🏆 Project Anchor (Flagship Project)

My flagship project demonstrates my ability to build end-to-end AI solutions.

### **[Resume Insight](https://github.com/henriqueai/resume-insight )**
> **ATS-style resume analyzer built with production-grade Prompt Engineering architecture.**
>
> **Highlight:** This project is a case study on treating prompts as versioned software assets, utilizing the **Structured Chain-of-Thought (S-CoT)** strategy to ensure accurate and reliable analysis results.

## 💡 My Edge (Why Hire Me)

My passion for building AI systems and my academic foundation allow me to be **more active and, in many cases, more capable than many Mid or Senior-level professionals** focused solely on legacy code.

I bring:
- **Product Vision:** Focus on solving the end-user's problem.
- **Constant Innovation:** Rapid adaptation to new AI technologies.
- **Architectural Focus:** Building scalable and maintainable systems.

## 🗺️ My Strategic Roadmap (Next 12 Months)

My goal is to transition from a highly skilled Prompt Engineer to a **Certified AI Systems Architect** with production experience. This roadmap focuses on closing the gap between advanced prompt design and scalable cloud deployment.

| Phase | Focus Area | Key Deliverable | Strategic Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1 (0-6 Months)** | **Cloud & Integration** | **Project Anchor 2.0 (RAG System)** | Validate ability to build scalable, data-aware AI solutions on the cloud. |
| **Phase 2 (6-12 Months)** | **Production & Reliability** | **Project Anchor 3.0 (Prompt A/B Testing)** | Prove mastery over the AI asset lifecycle (Prompt as Code) and system optimization. |

### **Phase 1 Detail: Cloud & Integration**

| Skill/Certification | Target | Project Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Fundamentals** | **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** | Deploy Project Anchor 2.0 using Serverless functions (AWS Lambda). |
| **Data-Aware AI** | **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | Build a system that uses prompts to query and summarize external data sources. |
| **API Design** | **JSON Schema Validation (Zod/Pydantic)** | Ensure the API for Project Anchor 2.0 is fully type-safe and robust. |

### **Phase 2 Detail: Production & Reliability**

| Skill/Certification | Target | Project Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MLOps/Version Control** | **DVC (Data Version Control)** | Version control all prompts and test datasets for Project Anchor 3.0. |
| **System Optimization** | **Prompt A/B Testing Framework** | Implement a system to measure and compare the performance of different prompt strategies in a simulated production environment. |
| **Security** | **Prompt Injection Mitigation** | Implement security layers against adversarial attacks on the LLM. |
