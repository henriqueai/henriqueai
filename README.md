## 🚀 What I Do

I am a **Prompt Engineer** focused on turning complex AI ideas into **reliable, production-ready systems**. My expertise lies in applying Software Engineering principles to prompt design, ensuring:

- **Reliability:** Using strategies like Structured Chain-of-Thought (S-CoT) to minimize hallucinations.
- **Maintainability:** Treating prompts as versioned software assets (Prompt as Code).
- **Integration:** Designing JSON Schema output for seamless backend integration (TypeScript/Python).

## 🎓 My Credentials (Technical Credibility)

Despite my age, I invest in world-class education to ensure my projects are built on a solid foundation.

| Institution | Course/Area | Strategic Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Harvard University** | CS50: Introduction to Computer Science | Fundamentals of Algorithms and Data Structures |
| **Stanford University** | Cybersecurity 
| **Google** | IT and Cybersecurity Certifications | Security, Infrastructure, and Operations |
| **University of Helsinki** | Elements of AI | Ethics, Implications, and AI Fundamentals |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

My approach is language-agnostic, focused on solving the problem.

- **Languages:** TypeScript, Python, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), AI APIs (OpenAI, Gemini)
- **Methodology:** Prompt Engineering, System Design, Software Architecture

## 🏆 Project Anchor (Flagship Project)

My flagship project demonstrates my ability to build end-to-end AI solutions.
